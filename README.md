# Natours---website-project


Natours website project created after learning things from Advanced CSS and Sass: Flexbox, Grid, Animations and More! course on Udemy by Jonas Schmedtmann. 


# What I learned in this project?


    CSS and SASS - more advanced things in CSS and take a look on SASS for first time (very enjoying it!)
    BEM (Block Element Modifier) - of course all written in BEM methodology 
    Transitions - many great effects with transitions, animations and other cool staff!
    Color-gradients - I used many color-gradients and see how powerfull and beauty they are!
    Background Images, Background Videos and more - In responsive way I learned the responsive images in html for first time and check how powerfull they are and helpful.
    
    
    
# Full responsive for all devices 

I made this website not only for desktop browser users but of course for all people who want to see it for example on phones tablets and more!
I did also some responsive images in HTML to improve efficiency to this website


And of course i'm not 100% author of this website, all credits are for Jonas Schmedtmann.
